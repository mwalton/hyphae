üçÑ‚Äçüü´ Neighbor-sensing model of fungal hyphal growth using p5.js

This implementation is inspired by, and a simplified version of a [Neighbor-sensing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbour-sensing_model) used to study the morphogenesis of fungal hyphal networks. David Moore's [World of Cyberfungi](https://www.davidmoore.org.uk/CyberWEB/Cyber03.htm) provides a nice mathematical description of the model based on the originating paper [Concerted regulation of all hyphal tips generates fungal fruit body structures: experiments with computer visualizations produced by a new mathematical model of hyphal growth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15209276/)
